## Goals

- **Build an easily-hackable toolkit** for building games based around voxel globes. The simple case should be simple, and the migration path to greater customisation should be smooth.

- **Document everything**. Both the API and implementation should aim to teach. I'm also [blogging as I go](https://jeffparsons.github.io/).

- **Be open and welcoming**. If you have a question, a suggestion, an idea, or just want to say "hi", please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/jeffparsons/planetkit/issues/new?title=Hi%20there!).


## Non-goals

- **Build a game engine**. I'm going to end up doing this accidentally. But my preference is to use existing libraries where they exist, and contribute to them where it makes sense.

- **Expose a stable API**. I do value stability, but PlanetKit is too young and exploratory to be thinking about that just yet. If you use it for something, I'll help you deal with breakage.

- **Meet everyone's needs**. I intend to focus on a very narrow set of game styles. But "narrow" is hard to define clearly. If you're not sure whether our visions are aligned, please open an issue!
